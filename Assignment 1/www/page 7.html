          <h3> How To </h3>
           <h4>With Liquid Latex</h4>
                <p> Liquid latex is good for achieving a generally deathly look, as well as building up wounds or other facial deformities.
                You should be able to find it at seasonal Halloween supply stores, or at beauty supply chains.</p>

                <p>Use the "stretch and stipple" technique. Stretching out your skin as you apply latex ensures that you won't have any accidental blank patches. Additionally, it will leave you with some decidedly creepy wrinkling when the latex dries.</p>

                <p>Gently spread or stretch the area of skin you're painting. It's best to do this technique one area at a time (i.e., forehead, one cheek, chin, etc.).</p>

                <p> Using a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge, apply a thin layer of liquid latex to the area in small stippling motions. Keep your strokes light and short.</p>

                <p>Build up deformities or wound sites. You can use these techniques to make the face look misshapen, or lay the groundwork for a scabbing "wound."</p>

                <p> Apply another layer of latex to "build" your make up. Creating light layers of latex, instead of smearing on thick amounts, creates even coverage with minimal clumping.</p>

                <p> Mix a little bit of uncooked oatmeal with the latex, then apply in one or two small areas on the face. This is great for a gangrenous or scabby look.</p>

                <p> Put single-ply tissue between latex layers. Get a piece of toilet paper, and separate the sheets so that you have a single ply. Rip the edges until you have the shape and size you want. Hold it over an area with a base latex layer already underneath it, and paint another layer over it. It will help disguise the smoothness of your skin with a rotting texture</p>

               <p>Put wounds or scabs into latex. By selectively ripping parts of the liquid latex, you can put wide gashes or small lacerations into your new skin.

               <p> Use scissors. You should carefully snip the latex until you create the wound you want. Be careful not to nick your skin!</p>

  
               <p> Use a toothpick. Simply stick it into the liquid latex and drag it through for a gaping wound.</p>

               <p>Apply liquid foundation. With the fake wound opened up you now want to apply liquid foundation to the tissue and latex. 
               Make sure that you apply the foundation in a way so that it blends out from the latex and tissue onto your actual skin.
               Rub the surrounding area with your finger to further blend. </p>

               <p>Apply powder, eyeshadow, and fake blood to create the bloody part of the wound. Using your eyeshadow and any red powders, you can use your brush to add these to your wound.
               Paint around the wound and on your actual skin with darker colors in the center of your wound. Use lighter colors as you progress outward.
               Add a few drops of blood and mix. Then add a few more in and around the wound and let the blood drip.</p>
